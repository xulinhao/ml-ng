# Results of Machine Learning

Here are the results of all programming work at [https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome).

The corresponding implemetation of all exercises, with TensorFlow v2.0, will be added under the same folder of "machine-learning-xxx". Specifically, the final folder structure is like bellow:
```
machine-learning-ex1
├── ex1
│   └── ...
├── ex1.pdf
└── py1                 # implmented with Python
│   ├── compute_cost.py # corresponding implemetation of ex1/computeCost.m
│   └── ...
└── tf1                 # implmented with TensorFlow
    └── ...
```

Note: I only add the python implementation of linear regression with a single variable under machine-learning-ex1.
